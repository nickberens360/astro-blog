# Hello from the automation system!

This is a test article generated by the article-generator system.

## Features

- Automated content generation
- Git-based publishing
- Netlify deployment
- Medium integration

Pretty cool, right?

## How It Works

The system generates articles using LLMs, writes them to the Astro blog repository, commits to Git, and Netlify automatically deploys them.

## Next Steps

Once this test succeeds, we can:

1. Generate real articles with AI
2. Publish to Medium automatically
3. Run on a schedule

Let's see if this works!
