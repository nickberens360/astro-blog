# 7 ChatGPT Commands Every New User Should Know

Getting started with ChatGPT can feel overwhelming. While the interface seems simple, knowing the right commands and prompting techniques can dramatically improve your results. Let's explore the essential commands that will help you get more value from your ChatGPT conversations.

## What are the basic formatting commands?

The most fundamental way to control ChatGPT's output is through formatting commands. These tell the AI exactly how you want information presented.

### Markdown Commands
- Use "Write in markdown" to get properly formatted headers, lists, and emphasis
- Request "Use H2 and H3 headers" for clear section organization
- Ask for "bullet points" or "numbered lists" when you need structured information

### Output Length Control
- "Keep it under X words" sets a maximum length
- "Write a detailed response of at least X words" ensures thorough coverage
- "Give me a brief summary" for quick takeaways

Pro tip: Start your prompt with formatting instructions to ensure they apply to the entire response.

## How do you set the right context and role?

One of ChatGPT's most powerful features is its ability to adopt different personas and expertise levels.

### Role Setting
"Act as a [role]" - Examples include:
- Technical writer
- Marketing expert
- Code reviewer
- History teacher
- Business consultant

### Expertise Level
Specify the target audience:
- "Explain like I'm 5"
- "Write for a beginner audience"
- "Assume advanced knowledge of [topic]"
- "Use technical language appropriate for professionals"

## What commands help with iterative improvement?

ChatGPT excels at refining and improving content through follow-up commands.

### Revision Commands
- "Revise the above for clarity"
- "Make this more concise"
- "Expand on point #3"
- "Add more specific examples"
- "Rewrite in a more professional tone"

### Analysis Commands
- "Identify the main arguments"
- "What are the potential weaknesses in this text?"
- "Suggest improvements for this draft"
- "Check for logical inconsistencies"

## How do you extract specific information?

When you need focused answers or particular data formats, these commands help narrow down the response.

### Data Extraction
- "List all the [items] mentioned above"
- "Extract key statistics from this text"
- "Summarize the main points in bullet form"
- "Create a table comparing these elements"

### Format Specification
- "Present this as a step-by-step guide"
- "Format as a FAQ"
- "Organize this into pros and cons"
- "Create a timeline of events"

## What commands ensure accuracy and citations?

While ChatGPT can't browse the internet, these commands help maintain quality and accuracy.

### Fact-Checking Commands
- "What's your confidence level about this information?"
- "What are the limitations of your knowledge on this topic?"
- "When was your training data cut off?"
- "Are there any assumptions in this response?"

### Source Requests
- "Can you cite specific sources for these claims?"
- "What type of sources would verify this information?"
- "Where could I find more authoritative information on this?"

## How do you handle creative and analytical tasks?

Different types of tasks require specific command approaches.

### Creative Commands
- "Generate 5 unique ideas for [topic]"
- "Brainstorm solutions to [problem]"
- "Create variations of this concept"
- "Develop a creative analogy for [concept]"

### Analytical Commands
- "Analyze the pros and cons"
- "Break this down into component parts"
- "Identify potential risks and opportunities"
- "Compare and contrast these approaches"

## Common Pitfalls and Adjustments

### Accuracy Issues
- ChatGPT may occasionally generate plausible-sounding but incorrect information
- Always verify critical information from authoritative sources
- Be specific about your requirements for accuracy and detail

### Context Problems
- The AI might miss important context from earlier in the conversation
- Summarize relevant previous information in new prompts
- Use "Let's approach this step by step" for complex topics

### Output Consistency
- Responses may vary even with identical prompts
- Save effective prompts for future use
- Break complex requests into smaller, more manageable parts

### Length and Detail Balance
- Very long outputs may lose focus or repeat information
- Too brief responses might miss crucial details
- Adjust length requirements based on topic complexity

## Best Practices for Command Usage

1. **Start Broad, Then Refine**
   - Begin with general queries
   - Use follow-up commands to narrow focus
   - Build on previous responses

2. **Be Specific**
   - Clear, detailed instructions get better results
   - Specify format, length, and tone
   - Include examples when possible

3. **Maintain Context**
   - Reference previous parts of the conversation
   - Summarize important points
   - Confirm understanding before moving forward

4. **Iterate and Improve**
   - Use feedback commands to refine responses
   - Ask for alternatives and variations
   - Build on successful prompts

5. **Verify and Validate**
   - Cross-check important information
   - Ask for limitations and confidence levels
   - Use external sources for verification

Remember that ChatGPT is a tool to assist and augment your work, not replace critical thinking or expertise. These commands provide a foundation for effective interaction, but you'll develop your own style and preferences as you gain experience.

Pro tip: Keep a document of your most effective prompts and commands for future reference. This "prompt library" will become an invaluable resource as you continue working with ChatGPT.

The key to mastering ChatGPT commands is practice and experimentation. Start with these basic commands and gradually incorporate more advanced techniques as you become comfortable with the platform's capabilities and limitations.

## Advanced Command Combinations
