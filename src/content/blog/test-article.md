# Test Article: Time-Blocking for Engineers

This is a test article to verify our publishing pipeline works correctly.

## Why Time-Blocking Works

Time-blocking is a powerful productivity technique that helps engineers:

- Focus on deep work
- Minimize context switching
- Improve work-life balance

## Implementation Steps

1. **Audit your time** - Track where your time goes for 2-3 days
2. **Block your calendar** - Reserve specific times for specific tasks
3. **Protect deep work** - Defend your focus time from interruptions

## Code Example

Here's a simple Python script to schedule blocks:

```python
def create_time_block(start_time, duration, task):
    """Create a time block in your calendar"""
    end_time = start_time + duration
    return {
        'start': start_time,
        'end': end_time,
        'task': task,
        'protected': True
    }
```

## Conclusion

Time-blocking isn't about perfectionâ€”it's about creating a framework that protects your most valuable work.

Try it for two weeks and measure the results.
